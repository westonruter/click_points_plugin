# Click Points Plugin

The Click Points Plugin is a WordPress novelty designed to display the author's abilities much more than it is to actually be useful.  The premise of the plugin is to claim virtual Rewards by completing events (clicking buttons) to earn Points.  The events are buttons displayed in a sidebar widget.  When clicked, the buttons award points to the user, along with a funny little message explaining why they got the points.  Points totals can be viewed on a User Points Page (generated via shortcode), including a listing of the ways the points were earned.  Finally, points can be redeemed for imaginary Rewards on a Rewards Page (again, generated via shortcode).

It is my hope that Click Points will help you get a feel for my experience level, and perhaps give you a little grin along the way.

### Setup Instructions

***Install/Activate Click Points Plugin***

This plugin installs just like any other WordPress Plugin.

***Customize Plugin Settings***

Navigate to Settings > Click Points.  Select which Action Buttons you want to display in the widget.

***Activate Click Points Widget***

There are no settings on this widget.  Just add it to a sidebar and you're ready to go!

***Create User Points Page with Shortcode***

Create a Page (I recommend titling it "User Points") and use the [click-points] shortcode.  This Shortcode displays a user's points earned, as well as what Events they have clicked to earn/spend points.

***Create Rewards Page with Shortcode***

Create a Page (I recommend titling it "Rewards") and use the [click-points-rewards] shortcode.  This page displays Rewards to be purchased with your points.

***Enjoy!***

Start using Click Points by clicking on the buttons in the Click Points Widget. Each click will generate a fun little message about how you just earned your points.

Check on your progress by visiting your User Points Shortcode Page.

Cash in your Points for Rewards on your Rewards Shortcode Page.  These Rewards will be reflected on the User Points Shortcode Page, under "Recent Points".
